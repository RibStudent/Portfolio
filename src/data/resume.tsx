  summary:
    "I'm a cybersecurity specialist and full-stack developer based in Brisbane, completing my final semester at TAFE Queensland. I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and practical business solutions, helping small to medium-sized businesses compete in the digital landscape. What sets me apart? I'm staying on the absolute bleeding edge of AI—working with frameworks and models that are often less than a month old. I don't just write code or run security scans—I solve problems with the best tools available right now, combining expertise in cybersecurity, development, system administration, and cutting-edge AI implementation.",
